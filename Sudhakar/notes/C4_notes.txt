Final Project Notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Self: New Popularity in Social Media Data set (UCI)
=======================================================
Could have used the scatter plot to present all the data I had.

Should be using multiple notebook to discuss or talk about stories that you are researching on.

Should have tried the Log function on 

UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php 
KG: https://www.kaggle.com/ 

David : Solar Flare Data Set (UCI)
==================================

Converted the some column values from Alpha Codes to numeric while loading the dataset from file.

2D Graph, he tried using the radio button to show or hide a data series; but could not make it work.  Idea is to make this graph interactive.

Diane : default of credit card clients data set (UCI) (12-15 hours)
===================================================================

Dataset has interesting info related to name, gender, education, age, etc.

Defined constants in code for some of the code; to keep code readable

Use the stacked bar plt.bar() to stack 2 series of data one over other.

Truly, tried to study all the data by converting them into visuals.  Instead of focusing on getting answers for a specific question.

Used a box plot with multi series (one plot with multiple series data)

Used a donut pie chart with multi series.  defaulters along with male/female distribution.  Looking really good.

Shyla : Wine Quality (UCI)
==========================

Used scatter plots to compare white vs. red wine nicely.  Also put that in the 3D plot, visually appealing.

Over lapped the Bar charts with different bar levels.  Also had good looking horizontal bar charts.

Ratna : 120 years of olympic history athletes and results (KG)
==============================================================

Histogram with men & women data series one after other.  Had manually handled year with no values using 

colors = ['Blue, 'Magenta']
legend = ['Men', 'Women']

plt.hist(Target, bins = 30, width = 2.0, color=colrs, alpha = 0.5)
plt.xticks(df['Year'], rotation = 90, size = 12) ==> plots only entries in this list ignoring the ones from histogram.
plt.xlim(1890, 2020) ==> Limits the scale

Also analyzed all parts of the data, slice and dicing and answering many questions.

Also plotted medals on a world map.

Taed: DNA Homozygosity (https://opensnp.org) wikipedia:zygosity read as well.
=============================================================================

70 people data in the data set, but each person had million location.  what location?? study about dna to understand.

converted data from each file to a million column flat file, and each row was from individual file with matching result for that column.  And then ran his analysis.

Scott Hughes: Personal dataset
==============================

It would be interesting to learn, how the data file is stored in a flash drive SSD (or) HDD at the low level.  To ensure the full file can be retrieved without media issues.

Johnathan: Taxi service Trajectory (UCI)
========================================

Dataset information about Geo location for trip data.


Mohan : Report of the number of forest fires in Brazil dividded by states (KG)
==============================================================================

Used searborn package & pandas.

Translated headers from Portuges to English

used np.polyfit (polynomial equation) with 3rd order, 4th order, etc seems to be not a good candidate for these graphs.

Boxenplot & Swarm plots seems to be interesting.

Margarita : Wine Dataset (UCI)
==============================
